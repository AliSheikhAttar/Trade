# Liquidity

Liquidity refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset or security can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price. The most liquid asset of all is cash itself. Consequently, the availability of cash to make such conversions is the biggest influence on whether a market can move efficiently.

The more liquid an asset is, the easier and more efficient it is to turn it back into cash. Less liquid assets take more time and may have a higher cost.

Key Takeaways
Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset, or security, can be converted into ready cash without affecting its market price.
Cash is the most liquid of assets, while tangible items are less liquid.
The two main types of liquidity are market liquidity and accounting liquidity.
Current, quick, and cash ratios are most commonly used to measure liquidity.

Understanding Liquidity
In other words, liquidity describes the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value. Cash is universally considered the most liquid asset because it can most quickly and easily be converted into other assets. Tangible assets, such as real estate, fine art, and collectibles, are all relatively illiquid. Other financial assets, ranging from equities to partnership units, fall at various places on the liquidity spectrum.

For example, if a person wants a $1,000 refrigerator, cash is the asset that can most easily be used to obtain it. If that person has no cash but a rare book collection that has been appraised at $1,000, they are unlikely to find someone willing to trade the refrigerator for their collection. Instead, they will have to sell the collection and use the cash to purchase the refrigerator.

That may be fine if the person can wait for months or years to make the purchase, but it could present a problem if the person has only a few days. They may have to sell the books at a discount, instead of waiting for a buyer who is willing to pay the full value. Rare books are an example of an illiquid asset.


There are two main measures of liquidity: market liquidity and accounting liquidity.
Market Liquidity
Market liquidity refers to the extent to which a market, such as a country’s stock market or a city’s real estate market, allows assets to be bought and sold at stable, transparent prices. In the example above, the market for refrigerators in exchange for rare books is so illiquid that it does not exist.

The stock market, on the other hand, is characterized by higher market liquidity. If an exchange has a high volume of trade that is not dominated by selling, the price that a buyer offers per share (the bid price) and the price that the seller is willing to accept (the ask price) will be fairly close to each other.

Investors, then, will not have to give up unrealized gains for a quick sale. When the spread between the bid and ask prices tightens, the market is more liquid; when it grows, the market instead becomes more illiquid. Markets for real estate are usually far less liquid than stock markets. The liquidity of markets for other assets, such as derivatives, contracts, currencies, or commodities, often depends on their size and how many open exchanges exist for them to be traded on.
