# **Half-Life in Algorithmic Trading**

#### **What is Half-Life?**

In algorithmic trading, the **half-life** of a mean-reverting time series is a measure of **mean reversion speed**. Specifically, it quantifies the time it takes for the deviation of a time series from its mean to reduce by half.

#### **Calculating Half-Life**

The half-life is derived from fitting an **autoregressive model of order 1 (AR(1))** to the time series. The steps are:

1. **Fit an AR(1) Model**:
   - The model is defined as:
     \[
     X_t = \alpha + \beta X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t
     \]
     - \( X_t \): Current value.
     - \( X_{t-1} \): Previous value.
     - \( \alpha \): Intercept.
     - \( \beta \): Slope or lag coefficient.
     - \( \epsilon_t \): Error term.

2. **Estimate the Lag Coefficient \( \beta \)**:
   - This coefficient indicates the persistence of the series.

3. **Calculate the Half-Life**:
   - Use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Half-Life} = -\frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(\beta)}
     \]
   - This formula calculates the time it takes for the impact of a shock to the system to decay by half.

#### **Application in Algorithmic Trading**

- **Determining Rebalancing Frequency**:
  - The half-life informs how often a mean-reversion strategy should be rebalanced.
  - Short half-life implies more frequent trading to exploit quick reversions.

- **Position Sizing and Duration**:
  - Helps in deciding how long to hold a position before mean reversion dissipates.

- **Strategy Development**:
  - Selecting assets or spreads with favorable mean-reversion characteristics (appropriate half-life) enhances strategy effectiveness.

#### **Example**

- **Pairs Trading**:
  - Assets A and B form a pair with a spread.
  - Calculating the half-life of the spread helps determine the optimal holding period after entering a trade when the spread deviates from its mean.

#### **Limitations**

- **Assumption of Linearity**: The AR(1) model assumes linearity, which may not always hold in financial data.

- **Parameter Stability**: The estimated \( \beta \) can change over time, affecting the half-life calculation.

- **Transaction Costs**:
  - Frequent rebalancing in case of short half-life can erode profits due to higher transaction costs.

### **Combining Hurst Exponent and Half-Life in Trading**

Understanding both metrics provides a comprehensive view of market dynamics:

- **Strategy Selection**:
  - Use the Hurst exponent to identify whether a mean-reverting or trend-following strategy is appropriate.
  - Use the half-life to fine-tune the strategy parameters, such as the timing of trades.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Adjust strategies based on changes in \( H \) and half-life to maintain effectiveness in different market conditions.

---

### **Practical Considerations**

- **Regular Monitoring**:
  - Periodically recalculate the Hurst exponent and half-life to capture shifts in market behavior.

- **Data Quality**:
  - Ensure high-quality, high-frequency data for accurate calculations.

- **Backtesting**:
  - Test strategies with historical data using these metrics to evaluate performance before deployment.

- **Risk Management**:
  - Incorporate findings into risk models to adjust exposure based on the predictability of assets.

### **Conclusion**

- The **Hurst exponent** provides insight into the nature of a time series—whether it is mean-reverting, trending, or random—which is critical for selecting the appropriate trading strategy.

- The **half-life** quantifies the speed of mean reversion, helping traders optimize trade timing and holding periods for mean-reverting strategies.

By integrating these statistical measures, algorithmic traders can enhance their understanding of market behaviors, refine their strategies, and potentially improve trading performance.
