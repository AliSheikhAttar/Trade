Great question! Let me clarify the **cointegration statistics**, **intercept**, and **beta**, and explain their roles in the context of cointegration and how they relate to each pair.

---

### **1. Cointegration Statistics**
The **cointegration statistic** is the test statistic from the **CADF (Cointegrated Augmented Dickey-Fuller)** test, which measures whether two time series are cointegrated. 

- **What does it represent?**
  - It quantifies the strength of the cointegration relationship between two time series.
  - The test statistic is compared to critical values to determine whether the null hypothesis (no cointegration) can be rejected.

- **Null Hypothesis:** The two series are **not cointegrated**.
- **Alternative Hypothesis:** The two series are **cointegrated**.

- **How is it interpreted?**
  - A **more negative cointegration statistic** indicates stronger evidence of cointegration.
  - For example:
    - If the cointegration statistic is -4.5 and the critical value at the 95% confidence level is -3.5, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the series are cointegrated.
    - If the cointegration statistic is -2.0, and the critical value is -3.5, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (the pair is not cointegrated).

### **2. Intercept and Beta (Coefficients)**
The **intercept** and **beta** are the coefficients from the **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)** regression, which models the linear relationship between the two time series. These coefficients are specific to each cointegrated pair.

#### **The Regression Model**
The cointegration relationship between two time series \( Y \) (e.g., Crypto 2) and \( X \) (e.g., Crypto 1) is modeled as:
\[
Y_t = \text{Intercept} + \text{Beta} \cdot X_t + \epsilon_t
\]
Where:
- \( Y_t \): The price of Crypto 2 at time \( t \).
- \( X_t \): The price of Crypto 1 at time \( t \).
- **Intercept**: The constant term in the linear relationship.
- **Beta**: The slope coefficient that quantifies the relationship between the two series.
- \( \epsilon_t \): The residuals (or errors), which represent the difference between the actual \( Y_t \) and the predicted \( Y_t \).

#### **Key Points About the Coefficients:**
1. **Intercept:**
   - Represents the baseline value of \( Y \) when \( X \) is zero.
   - It adjusts for differences in the scale or magnitude of the two series.

2. **Beta:**
   - Represents the **sensitivity** of \( Y \) to changes in \( X \).
   - For example, if \( \text{Beta} = 0.8 \), it means that for every 1-unit increase in \( X \), \( Y \) increases by 0.8 units.
   - A beta close to 1 suggests a strong linear relationship between the two series.

3. **Residuals (\( \epsilon_t \)):**
   - The residuals are the difference between the actual \( Y \) and the predicted \( Y \) based on the regression model.
   - If the two series are cointegrated, the residuals (\( \epsilon_t \)) will be **stationary** (i.e., they fluctuate around a constant mean).

---

### **3. Combined Stationary Series**
The **combined stationary series** is created by subtracting the predicted \( Y \) (based on the regression) from the actual \( Y \). This removes the linear relationship between the two series and leaves the residuals (\( \epsilon_t \)), which should be stationary if the pair is cointegrated.

\[
\text{Combined Series} = Y_t - (\text{Intercept} + \text{Beta} \cdot X_t)
\]

- **Why is this important?**
  - The combined series represents the residuals of the cointegration relationship.
  - If the pair is cointegrated, the combined series will be stationary, meaning it fluctuates around a constant mean and can be used for mean-reversion strategies.

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Pair: BTC-USD and ETH-USD**
1. **Cointegration Statistic:**
   - Suppose the cointegration statistic is -4.5, and the critical value at 95% confidence is -3.5.
   - Since -4.5 < -3.5, the pair is cointegrated.

2. **Intercept and Beta:**
   - Intercept: 0.045
   - Beta: 0.98
   - The regression model is:
     \[
     \text{ETH-USD} = 0.045 + 0.98 \cdot \text{BTC-USD} + \epsilon_t
     \]

3. **Combined Series:**
   - The combined series is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Combined Series} = \text{ETH-USD} - (0.045 + 0.98 \cdot \text{BTC-USD})
     \]
   - If the pair is cointegrated, the combined series (residuals) will be stationary.

---

### **Summary**
1. **Cointegration Statistic:**
   - Measures the strength of the cointegration relationship.
   - A more negative value indicates stronger cointegration.

2. **Intercept and Beta:**
   - Represent the linear relationship between the two series.
   - Each pair has its own intercept and beta because the relationship is unique to that pair.

3. **Combined Stationary Series:**
   - Created by removing the linear relationship (intercept and beta) from the second series.
   - If the pair is cointegrated, the combined series will be stationary.
