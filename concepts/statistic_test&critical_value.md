Certainly! Let's dive deeper into **test statistic** and **critical values** in the context of the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test** and how they work in hypothesis testing.

---

### **1. What is the Test Statistic?**

The **test statistic** is a value calculated by the ADF test based on the time series data. It is used to determine whether the null hypothesis (H₀) should be rejected or not.

- The test statistic is essentially a measure of how strongly the data contradicts the null hypothesis.
- In the ADF test, the null hypothesis is that the time series is **non-stationary** (i.e., it has a unit root).

#### **How is the Test Statistic Calculated?**
The ADF test fits a regression model to the time series data, and the test statistic is derived from the estimated coefficient of the lagged value of the series.

The regression equation used in the ADF test is:
\[
\Delta y_t = \alpha + \beta t + \gamma y_{t-1} + \delta_1 \Delta y_{t-1} + \delta_2 \Delta y_{t-2} + \dots + \delta_k \Delta y_{t-k} + \epsilon_t
\]

- \( \Delta y_t \): The first difference of the series (\( y_t - y_{t-1} \)).
- \( \alpha \): Constant term.
- \( \beta t \): Trend term (optional).
- \( y_{t-1} \): The lagged value of the series.
- \( \delta_1, \delta_2, \dots \): Coefficients of lagged differences.
- \( \epsilon_t \): Error term.

The test statistic is based on the coefficient \( \gamma \) of \( y_{t-1} \). If \( \gamma \) is significantly different from zero, the series is stationary.

### **2. What Are Critical Values?**

The **critical values** are predefined threshold values used to evaluate the test statistic. They depend on the sample size and the significance level (e.g., 1%, 5%, or 10%).

- Critical values are derived from statistical theory and represent the boundary between rejecting and failing to reject the null hypothesis.
- They vary depending on the chosen **significance level**:
  - **1%**: Very strict threshold (low chance of false positives).
  - **5%**: Commonly used threshold in hypothesis testing.
  - **10%**: More lenient threshold.

#### **How Are Critical Values Used?**
- Compare the **test statistic** to the **critical values**.
- If the test statistic is **less than the critical value**, the null hypothesis (non-stationarity) is rejected, and the series is considered stationary.

---

### **3. How Do Test Statistic and Critical Values Work Together?**

The test statistic and critical values are compared to decide whether the time series is stationary. Here's how it works:

#### **Decision Rule:**
- If the **test statistic** is **less than the critical value** (e.g., at the 1%, 5%, or 10% level):
  - Reject the null hypothesis.
  - The series is likely **stationary**.
- If the **test statistic** is **greater than the critical value**:
  - Fail to reject the null hypothesis.
  - The series is likely **non-stationary**.

### **4. Example to Illustrate**

Let’s say we perform an ADF test on a cryptocurrency price series and get the following results:

- **Test Statistic**: -3.5
- **Critical Values**:
  - 1%: -3.4
  - 5%: -2.8
  - 10%: -2.5

#### **Interpretation:**
- The test statistic (-3.5) is **less than the critical value at 1% (-3.4)**.
- This means we reject the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level.
- The series is **stationary** at the 1% level of significance.

---

### **5. Why Do We Compare Test Statistic to Critical Values?**

The test statistic represents the actual behavior of the data, while the critical values represent the thresholds for deciding whether the null hypothesis is true or false.

- The **critical values** are derived from the theoretical distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.
- If the test statistic is more extreme than the critical value, it suggests that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis, so we reject it.

### **6. Summary of Key Points**

| **Term**            | **Meaning**                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Test Statistic**   | A value calculated from the data that measures how strongly the null hypothesis is contradicted. |
| **Critical Values**  | Thresholds that define the boundary for rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis.     |
| **Decision Rule**    | Reject H₀ if the test statistic is less than the critical value.                                |

### **7. Visual Representation**

Imagine a graph of the theoretical distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis:

- The **critical values** divide the graph into regions:
  - **Rejection Region**: If the test statistic falls here, reject the null hypothesis.
  - **Acceptance Region**: If the test statistic falls here, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

For example:
```
Critical Value (5%): -2.8
Test Statistic:      -3.5

Graph: 
  Rejection Region         Acceptance Region
<----------------|--------------------------->
Critical Value   Test Statistic
```

Since -3.5 is in the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis.

---

### **8. Why Are Both Important?**

- The **test statistic** is specific to your dataset and reflects the actual behavior of your time series.
- The **critical values** provide a theoretical benchmark to evaluate whether the test statistic is extreme enough to reject the null hypothesis.
